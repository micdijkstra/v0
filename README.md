# v0 â€” Web

Instead of starting new projects from the ground up, v0 takes commonly re-used
frameworks, plugins, and design patterns and makes makes it easy to start new
projects with these dependencies pre-included. It also speeds up development
time and code consistency within and between projects by re-using common
classes, naming conventions, and patterns. It's meant to be completely visually
agnostic, meaning there are no styles pre-included.

Sit down and write code.
